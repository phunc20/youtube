There are a total of 4 video clips on this series
(created by alfcnz and William Falcon). And I followed along and
edited the following Jupyter notebooks:
- The 1st and 2nd video clips share the same Jupyter notebook `1_MNIST_nn.ipynb`
- `3_same_code_with_lightning.ipynb` is for the 3rd
- `4_.ipynb` is for the 4th
