There are a total of 4 video clips on this series
(created by alfcnz and William Falcon). And I followed along and
edited the following Jupyter notebooks:
- The 1st and 2nd video clips share the same Jupyter notebook `1_MNIST_nn.ipynb`
- `3_same_code_with_lightning.ipynb` is for the 3rd
- `4_.ipynb` is for the 4th

## PyTorch Lightning Versions
By inspecting the release date (Aug 8, 2020) of the YouTube video(s) and
[github repo version releases](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/releases?page=13),
we can sort of deduce that the Colab notebooks are run with `pytorch-lightning==0.8.5`.
